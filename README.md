An experimental next-generation operating system written purely in Rust.

We are currently in the RT0 (Research Target 0) phase aiming for an early prototype
of a functioning operating system.

Research Targets are meant to allow quick and loose experimentation and help me gain a better
understanding about operating system developement in general.
Note that early Research Targets will very likely be terrible and not resemble our end goals in any way.
Subcomponents and even the whole fundamental OS/Kernel architecture are merely ad hoc placeholders
and *will* be replaced with well designed code at some point.
This bears repeating: Until a component has been nicely and thoughtfully designed we will guarentee
to fully break compatibility if and how we need to in order to replace it.
Only then (and definitely then) will the component by subject to our determined robustness and compatibility guarentees,
but let's not get ahead of selves, we don't even have an operating system yet.

I believe this type of iterative developement is the perfect vector to a well designed end product,
as proven beautifully by the Rust project.
Just don't expect anything of quality right now... or in the near future. :sparkles:
